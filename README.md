# **My Portfolio**

## Purpose of the Task:
In this project I have built a personal website to display my portfolio from scratch. I have implemented some of the things that were mentioned in the CSS unit. Though there is little to be displayed, there are a few information that would apply to most of the criteria!

## Changes:
- Added additional content to work section
